        <h2>About Me</h2>
        <p>
            Thank the lord a section with no pictures in it. Maybe I should put a picture of myself in here... but what
            happens if a potential employer likes my site, likes my work... looks at my photo and is like NOPE that
            fugly developer ain't ruining my whole A&F vibe I have going in my swanky startup company where everyone has
            a thin pencil mustache and is called Jean Paul. Why am I describing the French? No one here is French right?
            Is this what implicit bias is cause if so that would be hilarious. I love the French actually... not... who
            does. OKAY ENOUGH RACISM FOR A DAY! this is NOT the point of the project this is about me so where do I
            begin! Born and raised in Hong kong, studied in Switzerland, worked for The Peninsula and wasted my youth
            AND NOW IM HERE! is this enough text? Brb, let me save and check my live server. It's PRETTY decent but can
            do a bit more. Don't want my sections to look too skinny... won't properly reflect my..um...personality...
            shut up I know what you're thinking.
